TFGdb.com is designed to be a open database of free games for pc where any user can add content. The main aim was to provide quality information and direct download links for all the games in the database. It features an extensive backend for administrators to monitor and moderate content and users. It also features a very clean and user friendly interface including extensive search functionality allowing users to quickly find a game they like.

The website was programmed in PHP, CSS and HTMl and was integrated into the login and forum functionality of PHPBB. Apart from the login backend and forum, the website was built from scratch.

The site was designed in 2012 and iteratively built upon over the next couple of years. Due to lack of time it is now an abandoned project.
