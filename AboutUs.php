	<p>
		thefreegamesdb.com (now TFGdb.com) started when I could not find any sites dedicated to just free downloadable games with a decent amount of game filters. All I could find was small lists of games, sites focused on pay games with a few free games that are hard to find and lots of flash game websites. Taking my inspiration from <a href='http://thegamesdb.net/'>thegamesdb.net</a> (and the original name), I set about creating a site that could be edited and updated by anyone. This openness gives every developer big and small a chance to show off their masterpieces without having to wait for someone else to notice or write about it. I also set out to create a nice graphical interface for fan, box and banner art as well as screenshots, eventually allowing programs that manage your game collection to use the artwork. <br/>
		<br/>
		The site has been through a few code rewrites, each time teaching me better ways to code items and the site you see today is probably the third revision. I am quite open to suggestions about the site and design; most of the current interface has been tweaked from users comments so I welcome all feedback. If you want to give some feedback you can do so using our <a href='/Forum/'>forum</a>.<br/>
		<br/>
		You will also notice we are no longer thefreegamesdb.com we have moved to tfgdb.com, a domain name I think is much nicer than the old one.
